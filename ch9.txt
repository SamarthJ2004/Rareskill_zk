Saying a elliptic curve points form a cyclic group (under elliptic curve addition) means we can represent every number in a finite field as an elliptic curve point and add them together just like we would regular integers in a finite field.

Field modulus: p 
Curve Order:  the number of points on the elliptic curve (including the point at infinity),  the cycle length

Generator: the point from which all the other points can be generated by repeatedly doing the binary operation

Every elliptic curve point in a cyclic group has a “number” : i.e. the number of time the Generator has to be added to get that point

If the number of points is prime (i.e. the curve order is prime) then addition acts like finite fields
When the order of the curve matches the order of the finite field every operation you do in the finite field has a homomorphic equivalent in the elliptic curve.

To go from a finite field to an elliptic curve, we we pick one point (arbitrarily) to be the generator, then we multiply the element in the finite field by the generator.

the discrete logarithm problem: a scalar multiplied by a point will result in another point, and it is infeasible in general to calculate the scalar given the elliptic curve point.
