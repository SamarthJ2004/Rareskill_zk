Homomorphims

for 2 algebraic ds (A,:) and (B,;)

if there exists a function f : A -> B

f(a : b) = f(a);f(b) , where : and ; are the binary operators for A and B

Exercise:

1) take the function as a f(x) = x
2) take the value at a fixed point
3) f(x) = logx

Homomorphic Encryption
if the function f is computationally difficult to invert, then f homomorphically encrypts the elements of A

homomorphism is one directional
isomorphism is both ways
