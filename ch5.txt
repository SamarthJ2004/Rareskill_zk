Abstract Algebra

A Group is a set with a binary operator that is closed, associative, has an identity element, and where each element has an inverse.

Magma: A set with a closed binary operator
An algebraic structure is a set with a collection of operations on that set.
Semi group : is a Magma where the binary operator is associative
Monoid: is a semi group which has an identity element

ex1:
min(a,b) over integer is magma and semigroup but not a monoid ( since largest integer does not exists)
if +ve integers only (still not a monoid)

max(a,b) is a magma and semigroup but not a monoid over intergers
but is a monoid over +ve integers due to 0

ex2: all are magma
and, or, xor, xnor are monoid
but nand and nor are magma only

Group : is a monoid in which each element has an inverse
for all a belonging to A , there exists a a' belonging to A such that a x a' = i
where x is the operator and i is identity

1) strings under concatenation are not a group becuase they dont satisfy the associative property
2) a +b = c belonging to polynomial
a+ b =b+a
a + 0 = a
a+ (-a) = 0

Abelian : binary operator is commutative , technically group(not the binary operator) is abelian

Groups < Monoid < Semi Group < Magma < sets
