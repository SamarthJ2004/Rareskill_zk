Finite Groups: finite number of elements in it
Order of a grp: the number of elements in it
Cyclic groups: group which has an element such that every other element can be generated by repeatedly applying the binary operator to it or it's inverse (not every element in the group can do this)

Primitive root: g is a primitive root if for every integer a in the modulo finite group , there exists a k such that g^k = a (mod n)

If a group is cyclic , it is also abelian (commutative)
