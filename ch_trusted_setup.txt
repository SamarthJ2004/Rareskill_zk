Trusted Setup:
A trusted setup is a mechanism ZK-SNARKs use to evaluate a polynomial at a secret value.

Each setup created has a secret used to create the setup (using bilinear pairing) , and so if atleast one of the creator destroys their secret , the setup is tamper proof

=======================

Groth16

The Groth16 algorithm enables a quadratic arithmetic program to be computed by a prover over elliptic curve points derived in a trusted setup, and quickly checked by a verifier.
