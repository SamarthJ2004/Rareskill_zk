Elliptic Curve Point Addition

y^2= x^3 + ax + b

==>>  Elliptic Curves form an abelian group under addition

The identity element : is the point nowhere ( the point at infinity)
If a line intersects are 2 points , it will also intersect at a third point on the elliptic curve
So, the identity is infinity and the inverse if (x,y) is (x,-y) , the line passing through these 2 is a verticle line

It is an abelian group due to the property that there are exactly three or 1 points of intersection, so A (op) B = B (op) A

The point addition on elliptic curves is defined to be the third point flipped over the x axis i.e (x3, -y3)
(x1,y1) (op) (x2,y2) = (x3, -y3)

Formula for Addition:

for P1 = (x1, y1) and P2 = (x2, y2)
for P1 (op) P2 : the point addition

slope m = y2-y2/x2-x1

y = mx +c
y^2 = x^3 +ax +b

(mx+c) ^2 = x^3 + ax + b;

this is a cubic with the roots x1, x2, x3

x1 + x2 + x3 = m^2  (sum of roots = -b/a)
so , 

==================================

x3 = m^2 - x1 - x2
y3 = m(x3 - x1) - y1

==================================

Point Multiplication : adding to itself A (op) A
take the derivative at that point, get the intersection and flip the point about x axis

multiplication is just repetitive addition
