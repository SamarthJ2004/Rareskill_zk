Rank 1 constraint system

A Rank 1 Constraint System (R1CS) is an arithmetic circuit with the requirement that each equality constraint has one multiplication (and no restriction on the number of additions).

In a Rank 1 Constraint System the witness vector is a 1 X n vector that contains the value of all the input variables, the output variable, and the intermediate values,with the first one set to 1
1 equation: 1 multiplication

result = left_hand_side Ã— right_hand_side

System of equation of form : Oa = La * Ra (divide the given equation to multiple steps such that each has only one multiplication)
where O, L, R are matrix of size n * m

a is the witness vector
the number of rows: the number of constrains
the number of columns: the number of elements in the witness vector

Quadratic Arithmetic Programs

Addition is free i.e. we don't have to create any extra constaint for it


Circom is used to code

circom multiply2.circom --r1cs --sym
snarkjs r1cs print multiply2.r1cs

circom multiply2.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym
cd multiply2_js/
echo '{"x": "11", "y": "9"}' > input.json
node generate_witness.js multiply2.wasm input.json witness.wtns
snarkjs wtns export json witness.wtns witness.json
cat witness.json
