Rank 1 constraint system

A Rank 1 Constraint System (R1CS) is an arithmetic circuit with the requirement that each equality constraint has one multiplication (and no restriction on the number of additions).

In a Rank 1 Constraint System the witness vector is a 1 X n vector that contains the value of all the input variables, the output variable, and the intermediate values,with the first one set to 1
1 equation: 1 multiplication

result = left_hand_side Ã— right_hand_side

System of equation of form : Oa = La * Ra (divide the given equation to multiple steps such that each has only one multiplication)
where O, L, R are matrix of size n * m

a is the witness vector
the number of rows: the number of constrains
the number of columns: the number of elements in the witness vector

Quadratic Arithmetic Programs

Addition is free i.e. we don't have to create any extra constaint for it
