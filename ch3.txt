Finite Fields: the set of integers {0,1,2,...,p-1} where p is a prime
any number outside the set is mapped to a congruent (equivalent) element in the set

Modulo Arithmetic:

additive inverse
- 0 its own
- every number has exactly one
- they occur pairwise (expect for 0)

multiplicative inverse
- 0 has none
- 1 is its own
- each number has exactly one (except 0)
- p-1 is inverse of itself

Fermat Little Thm: a^p = a (mod p)
=> a^(p-2) is the multiplicative inverse of a

In finite fields there is no notion of even or odd
Division by 2 mean : multiplying by the inverse of 2 which always yields results

Finite field operations are associative, commutative, distributive

Square Roots: the 2 roots are the additive inverse and the number need not be perfect square

System of Linear Equations: The equations in regular maths and modular maths behave differently


Practise Problems:
1) let x = 0, and y = -z
2) the 2 roots are 2 and -4
 -4 == p -4
