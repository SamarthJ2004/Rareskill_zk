Problems in P: problems that can be solved and verified in polynomial time
Witness: proof that you solved the problem correctly
Problems in PSPACE: problems that require exponential resources to solve and verify but donâ€™t require exponential space
Problems in NP: problems that can be verified in polynomial time
ZK proofs are not usable for problems that can not be verified in polynomial time
All NP problems can be verified by modelling them to boolean circuits
NP: non-deterministic polynomial

P < NP < PSPACE

In ZK the "knowledge" referes to the knowledge of the witness, it seeks to demonstrate that you know the witness ( solution to the boolean circuit) without revealing it.
